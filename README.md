# Intro
This test has three parts. In each file there is a test case and it is your task to implement a fix for each one. If you get stuck but you know how to pseudo solve the problem you can write that as a comment. Feel free to refactor code and if you find bugs in the testcases fix them and point those out.

## Case 1
Split name strings into their respective parts

## Case 2
Fetch a user and populate all of their friends
